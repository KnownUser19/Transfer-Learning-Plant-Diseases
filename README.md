## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Prepare Dataset:**
   - Organize images into folders for training, validation, and testing (Keras `ImageDataGenerator` format).

2. **Initialize Image Data Generators:**
   - Normalize pixel values.
   - Set batch size and target size (128x128).

3. **Setup Transfer Learning Model:**
   - Load a pretrained model (e.g., VGG16, InceptionV3, ResNet50) without the top classification layer.
   - Freeze base layers for initial training.
   - Add custom dense layers for classification.

4. **Compile Model:**
   - Optimizer: Adam
   - Loss: Categorical Cross-Entropy

5. **Train Model:**
   - Use GPU acceleration (Colab recommended).
   - Monitor accuracy and loss.

6. **Evaluate Performance:**
   - Use test dataset for final accuracy.
   - Generate confusion matrix & classification reports.

7. **Save and Load Models:**
   - Save as `.h5` files for reuse.
   - Reload for inference or fine-tuning.

8. **Visualize Results:**
   - Plot accuracy/loss curves.
   - Show confusion matrices and performance reports.
